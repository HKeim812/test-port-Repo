    <div class="about-me">
      <p>That code above is basic right? That code is the reason this portfolio was created. I have no reason to code, but that little line is what had me hooked the first time I had that display after something I typed in a terminal.</p>
      <p>This repository is simply to document what I learn and the skills I develop, a diary if you will.<span class="strikethrough">The tabs I have are just general topics I have learned and within there is breakdowns of things I found interesting.</span> So thats what I want it to be but... I need to build it first so... yeah.</p>
      <p>So have a look if you want. If you don't, cool. I found <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/" target="_blank">this cool public API</a> that generates pictures of people who do not exist you can check out instead I guess... </p>
      <p>If you want to help make me and 100,000s other become a better developer, go donate to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.</a> </p>
