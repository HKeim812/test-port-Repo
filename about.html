    <h3 class="am-opener">Hello, I'm Holley!</h3>
    <p class="about-me">I am an aspiring software developer. I am unsure of the focus that I'd like to have just yet. So far my exploration has allowed me to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some relational database basics.</p>
    <p class="about-me">I have an odd background of things that I have done. I was previously a colligete softball player, a press-machine operator, a florist, and a 9-1-1 dispatcher. I decided to move into something that would be temporary until I found my next step. The temporary step turned to be more permanent. The role I found myself in was mainly customer service but soon grew into much more.</p>
    <p class="about-me">I am a very curious person and I love to learn. I have always been the type of person to take things apart to see how they work. I have always been interested in technology and how it works. I am excited to learn more about software development and how I can use it to solve problems.</p>
    <p class="about-me">I am currently working on a few projects to help me learn more about software development. I am also looking for opportunities to work with others and learn from them. If you have any suggestions or would like to work together, please feel free to reach out!</p>
